# Car Price Prediction Model 🚗
### Project Overview
 This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict car prices using historical sales data. It utilizes a Lasso regression model, Random forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression to estimate car prices based on key vehicle attributes. The system includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and an interactive chatbot for real-time predictions.
Additionally, this project integrates a Chatbot Assistant 🤖, which allows users to interact with the model and get real-time price predictions and car insights.  

    
### 📌Key Features
🔹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Encoded categorical features like Gearbox, Fuel Type, and Car Type using One-Hot Encoding.
- Standardized numerical values (e.g., Mileage) for better model performance.
  
### - Implemented Regression Models for Price Prediction:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting
Lasso Regression
Evaluated using R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Features
- **Natural Language Search:** Users can search for specific brands, models, or categories (e.g., "electric cars") using intuitive queries.
- **Price Analytics:** Provides minimum, maximum, and average price insights for various car brands.
- **Smart Filtering:** Supports multi-criteria searches, including budget constraints and specific features.
- **Technical Performance:** Implements a Random Forest Regressor with an R² score of 0.92, ensuring reliable predictions.
- **Efficient Data Processing:** Uses an SQL processor for handling over 17,000 vehicle records with lightning-fast query responses.
