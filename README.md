# Car Price Prediction Model
### Machine Learning project to predict car prices

### - Project Overview

  This project focuses on predicting car prices using a machine-learning approach. By leveraging various regression models, we analyze a dataset containing detailed information about different cars, including features like brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the market price 
  of a car based on these attributes.

### - Key Highlights: 
  Data Processing: The dataset undergoes thorough preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into numerical formats using One-Hot Encoding. Numerical features are standardized to ensure uniform scaling across the model. Model Variety: Multiple regression models are tested, each 
  offering different strengths in predicting car prices. These models include Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Lasso Regression. Model Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using key metrics, including the R² score, which measures the explanatory power of the model, and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which quantifies the 
  accuracy of predictions. Best Model Selection: The model achieving the highest R² score is selected as the final model for deployment and future predictions. Project Structure cars_info.csv: The dataset file containing various car attributes. model_evaluation_results.csv: A CSV file containing the evaluation results of each model, including R² 
  scores and Mean Absolute Error values. best_model.pkpl: The serialized best model saved using joblib. This model has the highest performance in terms of prediction accuracy.
