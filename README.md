# Car Price Prediction Model
### Machine Learning project to predict car prices

- Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices using a machine-learning approach. By leveraging various regression models, we analyze a dataset containing detailed information about different cars, including features like brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and more. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts the market price of a car based on these attributes.
