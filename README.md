# Car Price Prediction Model 🚗
### Project Overview
   
 This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on predicting car prices using various regression models. The system analyzes car attributes like brand, model, manufacturing year, and mileage to accurately predict market prices.
 This project also integrates a Chatbot Assistant 🤖, allowing users to interact with the model and get real-time price predictions and car insights.
    
### 📌Key Features
🔹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Encoded categorical features like Gearbox, Fuel Type, and Car Type using One-Hot Encoding.
- Standardized numerical values (e.g., Mileage) for better model performance.
🔹 Machine Learning Models
- Implemented Classification Models to categorize cars as Expensive vs. Affordable:

- Logistic Regression ✅ (Best Model: 83.9% Accuracy)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) ✅ (83.5% Accuracy)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ✅ (82.2% Accuracy)
- Random Forest Classifier ❌ (78.4% Accuracy, overfitting issue)
  
### Implemented Regression Models for Price Prediction:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting
- Lasso Regression
- Evaluated using R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
