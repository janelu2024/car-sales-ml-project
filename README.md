# Car Price Prediction Model ðŸš—
### Project Overview
   
 This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on predicting car prices using various regression models. The system analyzes car attributes like brand, model, manufacturing year, and mileage to accurately predict market prices.
    
### Key Features

- Advanced-Data Processing: Implements thorough preprocessing, including missing value handling and categorical variable transformation using One-Hot Encoding
- Multiple Model Comparison: Tests several regression algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Lasso Regression
- Robust Evaluation: Uses RÂ² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for comprehensive model assessment
- Production-Ready: Includes model serialization for easy deployment
