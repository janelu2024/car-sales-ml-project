# Car Price Prediction Model 🚗
### Project Overview
   
 This repository contains a machine-learning project focused on predicting car prices using various regression models. The system analyzes car attributes like brand, model, manufacturing year, and mileage to accurately predict market prices.
 This project also integrates a Chatbot Assistant 🤖, allowing users to interact with the model and get real-time price predictions and car insights.
    
### 📌Key Features
🔹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates.
- Encoded categorical features like Gearbox, Fuel Type, and Car Type using One-Hot Encoding.
- Standardized numerical values (e.g., Mileage) for better model performance.
🔹 Machine Learning Models


### Features
- **Natural Language Search:** Users can search for specific brands, models, or categories (e.g., "electric cars") using intuitive queries.
- **Price Analytics:** Provides minimum, maximum, and average price insights for various car brands.
- **Smart Filtering:** Supports multi-criteria searches, including budget constraints and specific features.
- **Technical Performance:** Implements a Random Forest Regressor with an R² score of 0.92, ensuring reliable predictions.
- **Efficient Data Processing:** Uses an SQL processor for handling over 17,000 vehicle records with lightning-fast query responses.
